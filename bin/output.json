At each turn, we will situate texts in their cultural and historical contexts, attending not only to the specificity of a particular text's moment, but also to the forces of contingency and tradition at play in the construction of literary, cultural, and political communities. Throughout our discussions we will think about both the \"African-ness\" and \"American-ness\" of African American literature as collective and imaginative processes. Early African Americans wrote for a variety of reasons\u2014philosophical, political, pleasurable, instrumental\u2014and protesting slavery and racism was just one (albeit an important one) among many of those reasons. We will read letters, poems, sermons, songs, constitutions and bylaws for religious and civic organizations, stories, and texts that defy easy categorization.

This course aims to help students better understand power in organizations and to become more effective political actors in their professional careers. The course will address normative questions about power's legitimate purposes and the ethical constraints which should govern its use. We will also consider how the pursuit and attainment of power can affect people. In addition, the course will explore the nature of leadership and its relationship to power. Leadership, as we shall come to see in the course of the class, is an inherently ethical and personal concept. The course considers both realism and idealism, both \"getting things done\" and \"doing the right thing.\" The course involves reading a large number of cases and attempting to learn from the experiences of successful and failed organizational politicians/leaders. We will also draw upon a large body of popular management literature and social scientific research which has directly addressed the phenomena of power and leadership in and around organizations.

Time permitting, we will also discuss computational problems in microbiome analysis, protein function and structure prediction, genome assembly, and even historical linguistics. Students will learn the mathematical and computational foundations in these areas, read the current literature, and do a team research project. The course is designed for doctoral students in computer science, computer engineering, bioengineering, mathematics, and statistics, and does not depend on any prior background in biology. The technical material will depend on discrete algorithms, graph theory, simulations, and probabilistic analysis of algorithms. 4 graduate hours. No professional credit.

At each turn, we will situate texts in their cultural and historical contexts, attending not only to the specificity of a particular text's moment, but also to the forces of contingency and tradition at play in the construction of literary, cultural, and political communities. Throughout our discussions we will think about both the \"African-ness\" and \"American-ness\" of African American literature as collective and imaginative processes. Early African Americans wrote for a variety of reasons\u2014philosophical, political, pleasurable, instrumental\u2014and protesting slavery and racism was just one (albeit an important one) among many of those reasons. We will read letters, poems, sermons, songs, constitutions and bylaws for religious and civic organizations, stories, and texts that defy easy categorization. Writers may include Phillis Wheatley, David Walker, Maria Stewart, Frederick Douglass, Harriet Jacobs, Frances E.W. Harper, William Wells Brown, W.E.B.

But what does \"British literature\" really mean, especially in the context of an island archipelago populated by multiple nations (England, Ireland, Scotland, and Wales) and repeatedly subjected to foreign rule (either by violent invasion or dynastic succession)? The range of texts we thus characterize as \"early British literature\" is staggering, and part of our goal in this course will simply be to appreciate the sheer volume and breadth of written work created in Britain and Ireland between the sixth and eighteenth centuries. We will do this through a necessarily selective sampling of historical periods, languages, and genres. Our authors will range from the famous (e.g., Chaucer, Shakespeare, and Milton) to the lesser-known (e.g., Marie de France, Lady Mary Wroth, and Eliza Haywood) to the unknown (e.g., the anonymous Beowulf-poet).

Early African Americans wrote for a variety of reasons\u2014philosophical, political, pleasurable, instrumental\u2014and protesting slavery and racism was just one (albeit an important one) among many of those reasons.

Interrogates how national and transnational identities (at home and abroad), modernites, histories, and colonial and global narratives are built on ideas of racialized sexualities, and as such, is particularly interested in the study of queer diaspora. Importantly, this course utilizes transnational feminist frameworks for re-thinking issues related to sexuality, immigration, nation-building, race and gender.

The first part of the semester covers the linear theory of plasma waves, including: the cold plasma tensor, cold dispersion relation, normal modes, frequency plots, Clemmow-Mullaly-Allis diagram, acoustic modes, kinetic theory of plasma waves, hot tensor, Bernstein modes, electrostatic damping, cyclotron modes. The course then offers an introduction to non-linearities, with major emphasis on the quasi-linear theory as a natural extension from the kinetic theory of plasma waves. The final portion of the course provides a qualitative and quantitative description of the major techniques used to deliver energy and momentum to a plasma (heating and current drive), namely ion cyclotron heating, electron cyclotron, lower hybrid, electron Bernstein, and neutral beam injection. Examples of heating technologies are provided for both thermonuclear and industrial applications. The course comprises simple analytical and computational homework assignments. 4 graduate hours.

Is the freer flow of trade, people, and capital around the world responsible for the world's economic, social, and political ills, or are we inclined to say that, on balance, it is still a good thing? As more people become more connected across larger distances in different ways, are they following more of the same norms and growing aware of what they share, or are they more aware of cultural differences and see integration as a threat to social cohesion? Upon completion of this course, students should be able to demonstrate content expertise using both written and verbal communication skills. They will do so by: identifying the different drivers of the phenomenon widely described as globalization; distinguishing between the social, cultural, political, and economic processes of globalization and give examples of how they interact in specific and contingent ways; analyzing the advantages and disadvantages of further global integration; combining the different aspects of globalization into a coherent narrative; designing and defending their own alter-globalization campaign.

We consider how different dimensions of inequality have evolved over time, with special focus on inequalities across race, class, and gender. We assess how inequality shapes the lives of individuals in society, how and why inequality persists, and how people have worked to both challenge and reproduce their places in society. We approach social inequality from a variety of angles, developing an understanding of how inequality works in and through schooling, labor markets, employment, identity and prejudice, social mobility, and the role of major social institutions such as work, family, education, politics and law. We examine core statements of social stratification from sociology and engage with contemporary theories from sociology, psychology, political science, and economics. By the end of this course, you will have a clearer understanding of the types of inequality that exist in society, how inequality operates through the broader social context, and the constraints and opportunities faced by individuals in different positions in society.

These entrepreneurs play critical roles by both identifying and implementing new ideas and by diffusing them on a wider scale after initial experimentation. Finally, social workers often tend to be uninformed about sound business practices as they engage in social change efforts, yet knowledge of basic business concepts can be critical to the success or failure of a social venture.
